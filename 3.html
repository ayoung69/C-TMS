  <strong>creating <u>web</u> page</strong>
  <p style="margin-top:40px;">JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[6] often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language.<br>
     It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.<br>
Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web.[7] JavaScript enables interactive web<br>
pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it,[8] and all major web browsers have a dedicated<br>
 JavaScript engine to execute it.<br>
As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based)<br>
programming styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language<br>
 itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which<br>
 it is embedded.<p>
